Self-hosting the bot is a great way to have full control over your instance and customize it to your needs.
Below are the steps to get started with self-hosting.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- A server or a local machine with Node.js v22.16.0 installed.
- PNPM, you can install it by running `npm install -g pnpm`.
(Optional but recommended for efficient dependency management).
- Typescript, you can install it by running `npm install -g typescript`.
- Git, you can download it from the
[Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- PostgreSQL 16.9 installed and running. You can follow the
[PostgreSQL installation guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for your operating system.
- A Discord bot token. You can create a bot and get the token from the
[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Higher versions might work, but they are not supported.
