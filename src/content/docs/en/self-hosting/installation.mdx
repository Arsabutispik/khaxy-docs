To install the bot for self-hosting, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the bot's repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arsabutispik/Khaxy.git
   cd Khaxy
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
    Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    # If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it using npm:
    # npm install -g pnpm
    ```
3. **Configure environment variables**:
Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Open the `.env` file and set the following variables:
   - `TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token.
   - `GUILD_ID`: The ID of the Discord server for development purposes.
   - `CLIENT_ID`: The ID of your Discord application.
   - `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production` for production environments or `development` for development environments.
   - `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for your PostgreSQL database.
   - `DOCS_URL`: The URL for the documentation site. (Optional, defaults to `https://docs.khaxy.com`)

4. **Change Configuration**:
   Visit `config.toml` for various configuration options.

    Some information here may be mandatory, so be careful when editing the `config.toml` file.

5. **Set up the database**:
   Ensure your PostgreSQL database is running and accessible.
   You can create a new database for the bot or use an existing one.
   Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file with the correct connection string.
6. **Run the bot**:
   After configuring the environment variables, you can start the bot by running:
   ```bash
   pnpm deploy-commands # This deploys the slash commands to Discord
   pnpm start
   ```
