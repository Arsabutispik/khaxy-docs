Moderation settings are used for different moderation features.

## Mod Log Channel
The channel that is used to log the actions of the moderators.
This is used for transparency in the servers,
we suggest using this feature if you want your members to know who got a moderation action and why they got it.

## Mod Mail Channel
This feature is automatic, you can re-arrange the category position and rename the channels.
The feature allows your members to mod mail you for whatever purpose they might have.
This channel also logs a transcript of the mod mail itself.

## Mute Get All Roles
When a user is muted, this setting will remove all roles from the user and add the mute role.
This is useful for servers that want to keep their members from using any of their roles while muted.
After the user is unmuted, the bot will restore all roles that were removed.

## Register Day Limit
After a user joins the server, they will have a limited time to register.
If the user doesn't register in the given time, they will be kicked from the server.
Default is 0 days, which means that the user will not be kicked.

## Default Expiry
When a user is warned, this setting will set the default expiry time for the warning.
In future infractions can have a different outcome, but for now warnings won't do anything.
